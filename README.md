# Application Dashboard

Dashboard prototype for managers to be able to browse, sort, and filter job applications they receive on a web dashboard that they can use across a variety of devices.

Managers can also inspect an individual application to see more details, as well as flag applications to look at later or revisit.

## Mock API server

Run `json-server src/assets/data/generate.js`. This will run an in-memory database with randomly generated applications
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
